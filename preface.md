# Preface

I'm making this because I had a hard time finding the formal theory of databases online. Its not incredibly useful, but I find it very interesting.

Plan is to do following - some of this is LFS related 

1. **Relational Database Theory** Prototype deploying a website in Azure that has my own curriculum and examples to demonstrate the rigorous theory of relational databases. Ensure its modern looking and easily navigable[Percent complete 10%]
1. **Serve LFS** Include a service to serve the processed LFS data to people (API, direct download?)
1. **Explore LFS** Embed the Power BI dashboard I'm creating with the LFS data
1. **Feature Business & About** Include website content for Training business - contact info etc
